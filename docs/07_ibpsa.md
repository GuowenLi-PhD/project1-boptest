**IBPSA Project 2** is operated under the umbrella of the
International Building Performance Simulaton Association (https://ibpsa.org/).
The Project develops BOPTEST software infrastructure, emulators, and related extensions to
meet the growing needs of building and urban energy system controls development
and evaluation worldwide.  Software development continues under the
same open-source license to facilitate community development and to enable
access to all, including third-party developers to build applications
utilizing BOPTEST.  The anticipated generalized outcomes are as follows:

1. Outreach and community building activities that encourage community feedback on development and usage.
2. Enhanced framework software infrastructure for improved performance and additional features.
3. New emulators representing additional application scopes of interest to the community.
4. Benchmark results from CS solutions using BOPTEST.

Details of the work plan, participation, schedule, and meetings are available
on the menu bar on the left.

BOPTEST development started within the [IBPSA Project 1](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/index.html) Work Package 1.2.
With IBPSA Project 1 ending in Summer 2022, a proposal for a new IBPSA
Project focusing on continued BOPTEST development and usage
was approved by the IBPSA Board on July 12th, 2023, leading to the start of IBPSA Project 2.
