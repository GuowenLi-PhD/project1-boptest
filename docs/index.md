BOPTEST is designed to facilitate the performance evaluation and benchmarking of building control strategies.
It contains these key components:

1. **Run-Time Environment (RTE)**: Deployed with Docker and accessed with a RESTful HTTP API, use the RTE to set up tests, control building emulators, access data, and report KPIs.

2. **Test Case Repository**: A collection of ready-to-use building emulators representing a range of building types and HVAC systems.

3. **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Reporting**: A set of KPIs is calculated by the the RTE using data from the building emulator being controlled.

Head over to the [Software](/project1-boptest/software/index.html) page to start testing your control strategy or look at the [Results Dashboard](/project1-boptest/dashboard/index.html) to view and compare tested control strategies.

Stay up to date on the latest [News](/project1-boptest/blog/index.html) and development plans within a continuing [IBPSA Project](/project1-boptest/ibpsa/index.html).
