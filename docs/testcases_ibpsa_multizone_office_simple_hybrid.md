<h1><span style="color:grey">Test Case Name</span></h1>
``multizone_office_simple_hybrid``

<h1><span style="color:grey">Brief Description</span></h1>
<span style="color:grey">
The test case building, known as Infrax, is a four-story office building with 2,232 m<sup>2</sup> of conditioned space
located in Dilbeek, Brussels, Belgium. This office building
contains open-plan offices, cellular offices, and meeting rooms. The building
envelope model is composed of 27 zones, of which 21 are conditioned and 14
occupied. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors are mainly open offices and separate
zones exist for the north and south spaces, the individual meeting rooms and
the bathrooms (which are not conditioned). The ground floor includes
individual conference rooms and several facilities (first aid room, canteen,
storage and server rooms).

The supply heating system is composed of two ground source heat pumps.
The source-side of the heat pumps is connected to an array of 94 vertical
ground-source heat exchangers. The sink-side of the heat pumps is connected to a
water storage tank and to the manifold, from where heat is distributed to
multiple emission loops. Cooling is provided by means of two heat exchangers
connected to the vertical ground heat exchanger array and to a cooling tower.

The emission system of the building is hybrid, with TABS as the slow-reacting
system which provides the main load. To provide a fast-reacting peak load,
the system relies on conditioning the air from the air handling unit (AHU).
The AHU takes and conditions the air from outside and distributes it to the
different building zones through the ventilation ducts. Within the ducts there
exist VAV boxes and small re-heating coils for the fine-tuning of the building.
Nevertheless, not all zone ducts are equipped with the VAV boxes.
