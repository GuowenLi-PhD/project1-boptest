Purpose
=======
The goal of the Building Optimization Testing Framework (BOPTEST) is to
enable benchmarking of control strategies for building and district energy
systems, with a particular focus on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
(HVAC).  We believe that in doing so, we will facilitate the development and
adoption of new and improved control strategies for these systems that
will lead to cost, energy use, and carbon emission reduction for
energy infrastructures worldwide.  For example, control developers can understand
how new algorithms compare to the state-of-the-art, building owners can invest
in new control strategies with less risk knowing they have been tested, and
policy makers can set standard expectations of performance as well as invest
in further control development where needed.

Such a goal requires the use of simulation, since real buidings pose significant
operational risks for new control development and slow-changing, stochastic
operating conditions that make it difficult to perform controlled experiments
at scale.  However, simulation of realistic building and district energy systems
requires significant expertise in related physics modeling and
numerical simulation techniques and effort for development of such simulation
models fit for controls testing.  Such expertise, and corresponding resources
necessary to put forth the effort, are not shared by all stakeholders, particularly
control developers in fields outside that of building modeling and simulation.
Therefore, to be inclusive, such a goal also requires the enabling technology
to be easily accessible.

Technology

BOPTEST is composed of a number of software components.
