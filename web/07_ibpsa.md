BOPTEST has been developed within the [IBPSA Project 1](https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/index.html) Work Package 1.2.
With IBPSA Project 1 ending in Summer 2022, a proposal for a new IBPSA
Project is in the works that will extend the work of
IBPSA Project 1 WP1.2.  In particular, the new project would aim to further
develop BOPTEST software infrastructure, emulators, and related extensions to
meet the growing needs of building and urban energy system controls development
and evaluation worldwide.  Software development will continue under the
same open-source license to facilitate community development and to enable
access to all, including third-party developers to build applications
utilizing BOPTEST.  The anticipated generalized outcomes are as follows,
with more details forthecoming in a full proposal and eventual workplan:

1. Outreach and community building activities that encourage community feedback on development and usage.
2. Enhanced framework software infrastructure for improved performance and additional features.
3. New emulators representing additional application scopes of interest to the community.
4. Benchmark results from CS solutions using BOPTEST.
