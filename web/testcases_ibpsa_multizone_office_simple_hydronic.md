<h1><span style="color:grey">Test Case Name</span></h1>
``multizone_office_simple_hydronic``

<h1><span style="color:grey">Brief Description</span></h1>
<span style="color:grey">
The test case represents an office hydronic with two zones zones in Belgium. 
The building test case is modeled as a rectangular building
of 40x25 m and 15 m of height.
The height of each floor is considered to be 3 m,
and at each floor internal floors are added to account for the thermal mass.
Hence, the total floor area to be conditioned is 5000 m<sup>2</sup>.
The building is divided in two zones/spaces of equal floor area,
with their main fa√ßades oriented towards north (NZ) and south (SZ) respectively.
Each zone has a window-to-wall ratio of 50%.
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
Each zone is equipped with independent air handling units (AHUs) for ventilation
and circuits connected to fan-coil units (also known as ventiloconvectors) as the emission system.
Heat/cold is procuded by means of a gas boiler and a chiller.
