BOPTEST v0.4.0 has been released!  This is a new development version.  Highlights include:

- A new test case featuring a 2-zone apartment with floor heating system.
- The API request ``/results`` accepts lists of variable names with the parameter ``point_names`` instead of a single string variable name with the parameter ``point_name``.
- Changed API request ``/forecast`` to PUT and now accepts lists of variable names with the parameter ``point_names`` instead of returning data for all variables.  Also added parameters to the request ``interval`` and ``horizon``. Added API GET ``forecast_points`` to return available forecast point names and metadata from test case. Forecast point information added to test case documentation.  Removed APIs GET and PUT ``forecast_parameters``.
