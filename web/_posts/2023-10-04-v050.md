BOPTEST v0.5.0 has been released!  This is a new development version.  Highlights include:

- Added interface for communicating with a running test case through BACnet.
- Updated BOPTEST Docker container to use Python 3.10, pyfmi 2.11, and co-simulation FMUs. Also convert all test case FMUs to co-simulation.  This impacts simulation time (generally slower for multi-zone models) and introduces some non-backward compatibility.  Please see release notes for more details.

For all changes and more details, see [releasenotes.md](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/v0.5.0/releasenotes.md).
