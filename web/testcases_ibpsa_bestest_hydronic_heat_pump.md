# Test Case Name
``bestest_hydronic_heat_pump``

# Brief Description
This model represents a simplified residential dwelling for a family of 5
members, modeled as a single thermal zone, located in Brussels, Belgium.
The building envelope model is based on the BESTEST case 900 test case.
but it is scaled to an area that is four times larger. The rectangular floor
plan is 12 m by 16 m.  Internal walls are configured such that there are
around 12 rooms in the building.  The builiding further contains 24 m2 of
windows on the south facade.

An air-to-water modulating heat pump of 15 kW nominal heating capacity
extracts energy from the ambient air to heat up the floor heating emission
system. A fan blows ambient air through the heat
pump evaporator and circulation pump pumps water from the heat pump to the
floorr when the heat pump is operating.
