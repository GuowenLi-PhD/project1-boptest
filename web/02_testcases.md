Test cases are building emulators that contain everything needed to run
a test, including the dynamic model, embedded control logic, weather data,
electricity prices, and carboavailablen emission factors.  Each test case
also has predefined testing scenarios to choose from using the BOPTEST API.

Explore the available test cases listed in the menu on the left, as well as a
