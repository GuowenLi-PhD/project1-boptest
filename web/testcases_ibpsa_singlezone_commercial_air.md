``singlezone_commercial_air``

<h1><span style="color:grey">Brief Description</span></h1>
<span style="color:grey">
The test case represents a single zone retail store located in
New York City, New York, USA.  The construction, internal load, and occupancy
schedules are based on the U.S. DOE prototype building model for a single
store within the retail strip mall building complying with
ASHRAE Standard 90.1 2019.  The floor area is 348.4 m<sup>2</sup> and the south
facade has windows at a window-to-wall ratio of 26%.
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
The HVAC system is a single variable-air-volume (VAV) rooftop unit (RTU) with
supply fan, direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, and gas furnace heating coil.
The embedded control uses a thermostat in the zone for multi-stage control of
the supply fan and DX coil, and single-stage control for the heating coil.
