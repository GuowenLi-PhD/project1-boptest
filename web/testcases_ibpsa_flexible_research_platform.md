<h1><span style="color:grey">Test Case Name</span></h1>
``flexible_research_platform``

<h1><span style="color:grey">Brief Description</span></h1>
<span style="color:grey">
The test case represents ORNL’s two-story Flexible Research Platform (FRP)
located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. The FRP has 10 conditioned zones with a
floor area of 289 m<sup>2</sup>. The building is unoccupied, but occupancy is emulated through
research apparatuses that physically simulate internal loads for light commercial
buildings common in the United States’ existing building stock.
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
The conditioned zones are served by an Rooftop Unit (RTU) Variable Air Volume
(VAV) system with electric reheat.  The RTU supply fan, direct expansion (DX)
cooling coil, and gas furnace are controlled by a PI controller to maintain
a static pressure set point and the supply air
temperature set point, respectively. Additional PI controllers within the VAV
zone terminal units modulate the terminal unit
damper position and reheat output to meet the zone heating and cooling set point
temperatures. The test case has been calibrated with measured data from
various closed and open loop control tests.
